|LC Tools - Scene Switcher|
|-------------------------|

How To Use:
* Go to Tools->LC Tools->SceneSwitcher
* Click Add scene, this will create a new scene entry
* Assign a scene that you will be working on
* Repeat process until all scene entries needed have been created
* To remove a scene entry click remove scene from list
* Any scene added can then be opened/opened additively

Notes:
* In the settings there is a toggle for auto save, this should save any scenes that are closed via the Scene Switcher Window. This should work without any issues but it is worth saving just in case.
* In the settings, there is also a toggle for how scenes are open additively, if on, the scene will be loaded otherwise the scene will be added but unloaded.
